**Project Overview:**
In this project, I used **YOLOv5** for object detection across various video conditions, including thermal, grayscale, and RGB formats. The model performed well under all video conditions.

## Key Features:
- Utilized **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV** Python library for real-time object detection.
- Integrated **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for advanced detection and classification.
- Applied the model for **Teledyne FLIR Thermal Sensing** in ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems).

## Dataset:
- Total of **26,442 annotated frames**, including:
  - **9,711 thermal images**.
  - **7,498 video frames**.
- Model size: **6.1 GB**.

## Object Categories:
- **Person**, **Bike**, **Car**, **Motorcycle**, **Bus**, **Train**, **Truck**, **Traffic light**, **Fire Hydrant**, **Street Sign**, **Dog**, **Skateboard**, **Stroller**, **Scooter**, and other vehicles.

## Multi-Spectrum Precision:
The project accurately detected objects in:
- **RGB** (Regular color images).
- **Thermal Imaging** (Heat signatures).
- **Grayscale** (Monochrome format).

This project highlights the robust detection capability of YOLOv5 in different imaging conditions and environments.
